# MBA Hexagonal Architecture Project

This repository demonstrates the application of Hexagonal Architecture (Ports and Adapters) in a real-world project. Developed as part of an MBA program in Full Cycle Architecture, the project emphasizes clean code, decoupling business logic from external systems, and ensuring maintainability, testability, and flexibility in software design.
